## E-Othello Game Documentation

### Overview

The E-Othello game is an implementation of the classic Othello board game with an AI opponent using the Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax algorithm. This Python-based game utilizes the Pygame library for graphical interface and interaction.

### Features

- **Player Options**: Play against another human or an AI opponent.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) for the AI.
- **Dynamic UI**: Interactive graphical interface using Pygame for a user-friendly experience.
- **Game State Management**: Tracks game progress, current player turn, and displays scores dynamically.
- **End Game Handling**: Detects end conditions such as no available moves and determines the winner.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Components

1. **Board Module**
   - Manages the game board state.
   - Tracks piece placement and handles move validation.
   - Provides methods to determine available moves and apply player moves.

2. **Player Module**
   - Defines player types (Human or AI).
   - Implements the Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.
   - Selects the best move based on game state evaluation.

### Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure Python and Pygame are installed.
2. **Execution**: Run the main script (`main.py`) to start the game.
3. **Interaction**: Use mouse clicks to make moves when playing as a human player.
4. **AI Opponent**: AI decisions are displayed after a short delay, based on the chosen difficulty level.

### Future Improvements

- Enhanced AI strategies and algorithms.
- Additional features like game statistics and player customization.
- Optimization for performance and user interface enhancements.
